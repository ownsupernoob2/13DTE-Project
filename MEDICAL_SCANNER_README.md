# Medical Scanner System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A new medical scanning machine that reveals alien eye color and blood type data through an audio-visual mini-game. Players must match frequency and timing to successfully scan alien specimens.

## Components Created

### 1. Scanner Data Files
- `disk1_scanner_data.txt` - Class 1 alien data (Yellow eyes, X-Positive blood, 440Hz frequency)
- `disk2_scanner_data.txt` - Class 2 alien data (Green eyes, A-Neutral blood, 523.3Hz frequency)  
- `disk3_scanner_data.txt` - Class 3 alien data (Blue eyes, B-Volatile blood, 659.3Hz frequency)
- `disk4_scanner_data.txt` - Class 4 alien data (Purple eyes, C-Stable blood, 784Hz frequency)

### 2. Core Scripts
- `medical_scanner.gd` - Main scanner machine controller
- `scanner_ui.gd` - 2D interface for the scanning mini-game
- Updated `disk_manager.gd` - Added `get_scanner_data()` function to load scanner data files
- Updated `player.gd` - Added scanner interaction support

### 3. Scene Files
- `medical_scanner.tscn` - Physical 3D scanner machine with collision detection
- `scanner_ui.tscn` - 2D interface with scan lines, frequency slider, and results display

### 4. Game Integration
- Added scanner to main `demo.tscn` scene at position (5, 0, -3)
- Connected to player interaction system through scanner group membership
- Integrated with existing disk system for data loading

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Gameplay
1. **Hold a Disk** - Player must be holding a data disk to use scanner
2. **Frequency Matching** - Use vertical slider to match target frequency (changes per alien)
3. **Scan Line Timing** - Green scan line moves horizontally, player must click SCAN when in target zone
4. **Progressive Difficulty** - Game gets harder with each successful scan

### Difficulty Progression
- **Level 1** (Scans 1-2): Single vertical scan line, standard frequency tolerance
- **Level 2** (Scans 3-4): Dual scan lines (horizontal + vertical), both must be in target zone  
- **Level 3** (Scans 5+): Faster scan speed, tighter frequency tolerance, smaller target zones

### Audio Cues
- Beep rate increases as scan line approaches target zone
- Beep rate doubles when frequency is correctly matched
- Different target frequencies for each alien type create unique audio signatures

### Visual Feedback
- Green slider = Frequency matched, Red slider = Frequency incorrect
- Yellow scan button = Ready to scan, Gray button = Not ready
- Green flash on successful scan, Red flash on failed scan
- Target zone clearly marked in scan area

## How to Use

### For Players
1. Approach the medical scanner with a disk in hand
2. Click on the scanner to enter scanning mode
3. Adjust the frequency slider until it turns green (matches target)
4. Watch the scan line and click SCAN when it's in the yellow target zone
5. For advanced levels, both horizontal and vertical lines must be in target zone
6. View revealed eye color and blood type data
7. Click CLOSE to return to scanner mode

### For Developers
- Scanner can be placed anywhere in scene as `MedicalScanner` instance
- Data loaded automatically from `assets/disks/diskX_scanner_data.txt` files
- Difficulty scales automatically based on successful scans completed
- Scanner state managed through `can_use_scanner()` and related methods

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Disk System**: Uses DiskManager to load scanner-specific data files
- **Player System**: Added scanner interaction through using_computer detection
- **Camera System**: Scanner has its own camera for focused scanning view
- **Global State**: Respects Global.is_using_computer state management

### Future Expansion
- Audio frequency generation for real-time audio feedback
- More complex scan patterns (circular, diagonal movements)
- Additional scanner data fields (DNA sequences, metabolic rates)
- Multi-stage scanning for complex alien types
- Scanner upgrades and calibration mechanics

## Next Steps
The medical scanner system is now complete and integrated! Players can:
1. Use computer system to research alien classifications
2. Use lever system to mix sedation combinations  
3. Use NEW scanner system to reveal biological data
4. Use monitor system to classify aliens

All four core mechanics are now working together for a complete gameplay loop!
